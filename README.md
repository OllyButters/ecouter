# ECOUTER
These scripts are for use during an ECOUTER (www.bristol.ac.uk/ecouter) and include:
  * reshaping the .m42 file (JSON) and flattening it to extract a table of mindmap metadata
  
# Things to fix
  * generalise the script - currently it requires hard coding file path and the file you want to flatten
  * html links are in a dictionary, need to reshape as a string 
  * extract some summary stats including no of unique contributors, top five branches that have the most children.
